/* OpenSimplex (Simplectic) Noise in Scala
 * Ported by Mark Reuter from the origional Java implementation by Kurt Spencer
 * 
 * Origional GitHub Gist: https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19
 * Origional Reddit Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/2ieq7q/2d_and_4d_implementations_of_opensimplex_noise_too/
 * Origional Tumblr Post: http://uniblock.tumblr.com/post/99279694832/2d-and-4d-noise-too
 * 
 * v1.1 (October 5, 2014)
 * - Added 2D and 4D implementations.
 * - Proper gradient sets for all dimensions, from a
 *   dimensionally-generalizable scheme with an actual
 *   rhyme and reason behind it.
 * - Removed default permutation array in favor of
 *   default seed.
 * - Changed seed-based constructor to be independent
 *   of any particular randomization library, so results
 *   will be the same when ported to other languages.
